BY FIRE BE PURGED!
DIE, INSECT!
TOO SOON! YOU HAVE AWAKENED ME TOO SOON, EXECUTUS!
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS INTRUSION???
FOOL! YOU ALLOWED THESE INSECTS TO RUN RAMPANT THROUGH THE HALLOWED CORE?
YOU HAVE FAILED ME, EXECUTUS! 
JUSTICE SHALL BE MET, INDEED!
YOU AND YOUR KIND THOUGHT THAT THE FIRES OF DOOM HAD BEEN QUENCHED!
THIS WORLD AND ALL THAT YOU HOLD DEAR EXIST ONLY TO BURN!
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT!
TASTE THE FLAMES OF SULFURON!
MY PATIENCE IS DWINDLING! COME, GNATS: TO YOUR DEATH!
COME FORTH, MY SERVANTS! DEFEND YOUR MASTER!
THE REALM OF FIRE WILL CONSUME YOU!
BEGONE FROM MY REALM, INSECTS!
ENOUGH! I WILL FINISH THIS!
SULFURAS WILL BE YOUR END!
PATHETIC!
THIS IS MY REALM!
WHEN I FINISH THIS, YOUR PATHETIC MORTAL WORLD WILL BURN WITH MY VENGEANCE!
