**GETTING STARTED**

Before you check out all of our rooms, go to the bottom left of the webpage/desktop app and click the cogwheel. In there, you can change your display picture and several other settings to customize your experience here. 

We highly recommend that you enable Push To Talk. It'll help those in the same voice channels to not be annoyed if you've got a lot of background noise.

You can also ask @WoWbot for !help, or have these rules sent to you in a PM. Just type !help or !rules in any channel.

 ----------

**RULES**

 1. Be kind and respectful of others. Don't troll.
 2. Please don't self-promote anywhere other than the #content-creation channel. Please do not spam that channel.
 3. Do not post spoilers for anything, ever.
 4. Do not spam screenshots or pictures, especially NSFW ones. Do not post porn.
 5. Do not post sales, trades, etc. for gold or cash. THIS INCLUDES BOOSTS.
 6. Respect your Moderators and their decisions on how to handle issues. Any problems should always be taken to private message rather than chat.

 Violating these rules will result in warning, mute, or possible temporary or permanent ban from this server.
